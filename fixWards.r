##Run the code against Adi's flags
## Remove the wards where nothing is returned in Adi's new flags

##These people will be randomized in some way for phase 2b if we cannot use any of the other smart guesses below

#1There are a bunch of observations where people give us their ward # and also some information of where they Live
#see if we can rescue those by calling Adi's api without the ward info striped and then add back the ward number

#2If just ward is present, we have to remove the ward assigned, if there was a ward assigned

#3. Remove everyone that entered the example 12 main street pretoria. There are a fair number of these4.
