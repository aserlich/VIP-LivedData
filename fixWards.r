##Run the code against Adi's flags
## Remove the wards where nothing is returned
##These people will be randomized in some way for phase 2b if we cannot use any of the other smart guesses below

#There are a bunch of observations where people give us their ward # and also some information of where they Live
#see if we can rescue those by calling Adi's api without the ward info striped and then add back the ward number
#If just ward is present, we have to remove this observation

#Remove everyone that entered the example 12 main street pretoria
